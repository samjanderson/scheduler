# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler is a single-page app built with React where the user can book an appointment with an interviewer. There are 5 appointment slots for each day (Monday-Friday). An appointment can be edited or cancelled by the user. 

PostgreSQL is used as the database. Jest, Cypress and Storybook were also all used throughout the development process for testing purposes.

## Screenshots

The appointments section on the app is made up of various components that render depending on the state.
